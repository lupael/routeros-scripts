Install LTE firmware upgrade
============================

[◀ Go back to main README](../README.md)

Description
-----------

This script upgrades LTE firmware on compatible devices:

* R11e-LTE
* R11e-LTE-US
* R11e-4G
* R11e-LTE6

A temporary scheduler is created to be independent from terminal. Thus
starting the upgrade process over the broadband connection is supported.

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

The firmware is downloaded over the air, so a working broadband connection
on the lte interface to be updated is required! Having internet access from
different gateway is not sufficient!

Just install the script:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate unattended-lte-firmware-upgrade;

Usage and invocation
--------------------

Run the script if an upgrade for your LTE hardware is available:

    / system script run unattended-lte-firmware-upgrade;

Then be patient, go for a coffee and wait for the upgrade process to finish.
