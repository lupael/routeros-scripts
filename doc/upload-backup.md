Upload backup to server
=======================

[â—€ Go back to main README](../README.md)

ðŸ›ˆ This script can not be used on its own but requires the base installation.
See [main README](../README.md) for details.

Description
-----------

This script uploads binary backup (`/ system backup save`) and complete
configuration export (`/ export terse`) to external server.

### Sample notification

![upload-backup notification](upload-backup.d/notification.svg)

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Just install the script:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate upload-backup;

Configuration
-------------

The configuration goes to `global-config-overlay`, these are the parameters:

* `BackupSendBinary`: whether to send binary backup
* `BackupSendExport`: whether to send configuration export
* `BackupPassword`: password to encrypt the backup with
* `BackupRandomDelay`: delay up to amount of seconds when run from scheduler
* `BackupUploadUrl`: url to upload to
* `BackupUploadUser`: username for server authentication
* `BackupUploadPass`: password for server authentication

Also notification settings are required for e-mail, matrix and/or telegram.

### Issues with SFTP client

The RouterOS SFTP client is picky if it comes to authentication methods.
I had to disable all but password authentication on server side. For openssh
edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and add a directive like this, changed for your
needs:

    Match User mikrotik
        AuthenticationMethods password

Usage and invocation
--------------------

Just run the script:

    / system script run upload-backup;

Creating a scheduler may be an option:

    / system scheduler add interval=1w name=upload-backup on-event="/ system script run upload-backup;" start-time=09:25:00;
