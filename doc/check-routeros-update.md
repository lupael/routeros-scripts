Notify on RouterOS update
=========================

[â—€ Go back to main README](../README.md)

ðŸ›ˆ This script can not be used on its own but requires the base installation.
See [main README](../README.md) for details.

Description
-----------

The primary use of this script is to notify about RouterOS updates.

Run from a terminal you can start the update process or schedule it.

Centrally managing update process of several devices is possibly by
specifying versions safe to be updated on a web server.

Also installing patch updates (where just last digit is increased)
automatically is supported.

### Sample notification

![check-routeros-update notification](check-routeros-update.d/notification.svg)

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Just install the script:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate check-routeros-update;

And add a scheduler for automatic update notification:

    / system scheduler add interval=1d name=check-routeros-update on-event="/ system script run check-routeros-update;" start-time=startup;

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is required only if you want to control update process with
safe versions from a web server. The configuration goes to
`global-config-overlay`, this is the parameter:

* `SafeUpdateNeighbor`: install updates automatically if seen in neighbor list
* `SafeUpdateOnCap`: check for updates even if device is managed by CAPsMAN
* `SafeUpdatePatch`: install patch updates automatically
* `SafeUpdateUrl`: url to check for safe update, the channel (`long-term`,
`stable` or `testing`) is appended

Usage and invocation
--------------------

Be notified when run from scheduler or run it manually:

    / system script run check-routeros-update;

If an update is found you can install it right away.

Installing script [packages-update](packages-update.md) gives extra options.
