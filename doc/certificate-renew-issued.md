Optionally the certificates are exported with individual passphrases for
easy pick-up.

-----------------------------

Just install the script:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate certificate-renew-issued;

Configuration
-------------

The configuration goes to `global-config-overlay`, there is just one
parameter:

* `CertRenewPass`: an array holding individual passphrases for certificates

Usage and invocation
--------------------
