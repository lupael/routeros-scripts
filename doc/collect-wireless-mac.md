Collect MAC addresses in wireless access list
=============================================

[â—€ Go back to main README](../README.md)

ðŸ›ˆ This script can not be used on its own but requires the base installation.
See [main README](../README.md) for details.

Description
-----------

This script adds unknown MAC addresses of connected wireless devices to
address list. In addition a notification is sent.

By default the access list entry is disabled, but you can easily enable
and modify it to your needs.

### Sample notification

![collect-wireless-mac notification](collect-wireless-mac.d/notification.svg)

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Depending on whether you use CAPsMAN (`/ caps-man`) or local wireless
interface (`/ interface wireless`) you need to install a different script.

For CAPsMAN:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate collect-wireless-mac.capsman;

For local interface:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate collect-wireless-mac.local;

Configuration
-------------

On first run a disabled access list entry acting as marker (with comment
"`--- collected above ---`") is added. Move this entry to define where new
entries are to be added.

Also notification settings are required for e-mail, matrix and/or telegram.

Usage and invocation
--------------------

Run this script from a dhcp server as lease-script to collect the MAC
address when a new address is leased. You may want to use
[lease-script](lease-script.md).
