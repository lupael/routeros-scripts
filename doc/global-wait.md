Wait for global functions and modules
=====================================

[â—€ Go back to main README](../README.md)

ðŸ›ˆ This script can not be used on its own but requires the base installation.
See [main README](../README.md) for details.

Description
-----------

The global functions from `global-functions` and modules are loaded by
scheduler at system startup. Running these functions at system startup may
result in race condition where configuration and/or function are not yet
available. This script is supposed to wait for everything being prepared.

Do **not** add this script `global-wait` to the `global-scripts` scheduler!
It would inhibit the initialization of configuration and functions.

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Just install the script:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate global-wait;

... and add it to your scheduler, for example in combination with the module
to [manage VLANs on bridge ports](mod/bridge-port-vlan.md):

    / system scheduler add name=bridge-port-vlan on-event="/ system script run global-wait; :global BridgePortVlan; \$BridgePortVlan default;" start-time=startup;
