Renew certificates and notify on expiration
===========================================

[â—€ Go back to main README](../README.md)

ðŸ›ˆ This script can not be used on its own but requires the base installation.
See [main README](../README.md) for details.

Description
-----------

This script tries to download and renew certificates, then notifies about
certificates that are still about to expire.

### Sample notification

![check-certificates notification](check-certificates.d/notification.svg)

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Just install the script:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate check-certificates;

Configuration
-------------

The expiry notifications just require notification settings for e-mail,
matrix and/or telegram.

For automatic download and renewal of certificates you need configuration
in `global-config-overlay`, these are the parameters:

* `CertRenewPass`: an array of passphrases to try
* `CertRenewUrl`: the url to download certificates from

Certificates on the web server should be named `CN.pem` (`PEM` format) or
`CN.p12` (`PKCS#12` format).

Usage and invocation
--------------------

Just run the script:

    / system script run check-certificates;

... or create a scheduler for periodic execution:

    / system scheduler add interval=1d name=check-certificates on-event="/ system script run check-certificates;" start-time=startup;

Alternatively running on startup may be desired:

    / system scheduler add name=check-certificates-startup on-event="/ system script run check-certificates;" start-time=startup;
