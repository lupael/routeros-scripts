Rotate NTP servers
==================

[â—€ Go back to main README](../README.md)

ðŸ›ˆ This script can not be used on its own but requires the base installation.
See [main README](../README.md) for details.

Description
-----------

RouterOS requires NTP servers to be configured by IP address. Servers from a
pool may appear and disappear, leaving broken NTP configuration.

This script allows to rotate IP addresses from a given pool.

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Just install the script:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate rotate-ntp;

Configuration
-------------

The configuration goes to `global-config-overlay`, this is the parameter:

* `NtpPool`: dns name of ntp server pool

Usage and invocation
--------------------

Just run the script to update the NTP configuration with actual IP
addresses from pool if required.

Alternatively a scheduler can be created:

    / system scheduler add interval=5d name=rotate-ntp on-event="/ system script run rotate-ntp;" start-time=startup;
