Use WPA2 network with hotspot credentials
=========================================

[â—€ Go back to main README](../README.md)

ðŸ›ˆ This script can not be used on its own but requires the base installation.
See [main README](../README.md) for details.

Description
-----------

RouterOS supports an unlimited number of MAC address specific passphrases
for WPA2 encrypted wifi networks via access list. The idea of this script
is to transfer hotspot credentials to MAC address specific WPA2 passphrase.

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

You need a properly configured hotspot on one (open) SSID and a WP2 enabled
SSID with suffix "`-wpa`".

Then install the script:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate hotspot-to-wpa;

Configure your hotspot to use this script as `on-login` script:

    / ip hotspot user profile set on-login=hotspot-to-wpa [ find ];

### Automatic cleanup

With just `hotspot-to-wpa` installed the mac addresses will last in the
access list forever. Install the optional script for automatic cleanup:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate hotspot-to-wpa-cleanup,lease-script;

Create a scheduler:

    / system scheduler add interval=1d name=hotspot-to-wpa-cleanup on-event="/ system script run hotspot-to-wpa-cleanup;" start-time=startup;

And add the lease script to your wpa interfaces' dhcp server:

    / ip dhcp-server set lease-script=lease-script [ find where name~"wpa" ];

Configuration
-------------

On first run a disabled access list entry acting as marker (with comment
"`--- hotspot-to-wpa above ---`") is added. Move this entry to define where new
entries are to be added.

Usage and invocation
--------------------

Create hotspot login credentials:

    / ip hotspot user add add comment="Test User 1" name=user1 password=v3ry;
    / ip hotspot user add add comment="Test User 2" name=user2 password=s3cr3t;

Now let the users connect and login to the hotspot. After that the devices
(identified by MAC address) can connect to the WPA2 network, using the
passphrase from hotspot credentials.
